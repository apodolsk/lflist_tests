Can res == p suffer from ABA? Or is n->p == p safe as a guarantee of progress
for a? 

When does a->p change? What happens if you write p->n meantime? Suppose wrote
p->n but a->p changed. Then the signal must be lost, since the write
succeeded. Does this work with the eager reads done in swing_next?

If client is reading n->p

Redo swing_next if can't NULL because p if wrote a->p, it's likely that p
failed to write n. (Could also be that p had set out to write you before you
ever wrote p->n).

Client has no doubts about n->p, because it's swinging towards self. Only
patron has issue. It'll be swung towards p->p only if client exits swing_next,
so shall see res != a and res != p only if swing_next has terminated, and can
arrange a signal. Unless there's some artifact from previous loop iteration?

But even if patron reads n->p == p, does that ensure success? What if p and n
both were removed? Could use a gen, but better avoid it.

Is eager read in swing_next safe? Lost signal still works?

Can you assume patron is up-to-date if a->n == n?

Checking a->p == NULL checks whether p ignored p->n and died. What's the use
of writing a->p == NULL?

swing_next has ABA. If n->p was a->patron, doesn't mean n->p should be
a. Suppose read patron and n. Then patron writes a->n and exits and same for
local n. Then reinsert, with n->p == a->patron. 

Get rid of swing_next, or use gen? The issue is if n commits to swinging n->n
to a after a has written n->p to not be a. n->n->p 

Take 2.

a finds n = n or npatron. Sets p->n := n. 

Suppose n->p succeeds. But what if n already wrote a->n? Want n to NULL, so
that if n->p succeeds, then n will redo its work! And the NULL is permanent
then.

What if n->p fails? Then p couldn't have succeeded, so it must be on track to
write to your p. 

Suppose you write p->n then succeed in n->p. But then p had written a->p and
has missed that write. Does p recheck n? No n needs to fail its write to p->n
and to write to a->n.

So:
    write p->n till p is same.
    write n->p tills n is

Working on failure + success cases for help_patron.

If n->px is diff gen than px, could be that n was reborn without patron
running. So write patron then.

Do I read a->patron before attempting to modify n? Want the gen 

It's preferable to try to help patron first, before trying to write patron's
p. But do you need to know pat->gen before doing the help?

Need to ret pat->fails because if unlocking, need to know that pat didn't
write a->n since you read it.

Plan for help:

1 - if n is node and n->p is a, try linking. (n->p may change)
assume n still node
2 - if n->p is a->patron, swing n->p to a. To avoid ABA in (n->p == pat
implies a->patron == pat), get gen of n before the read. Suppose n->p ==
patron, gen is same as before patron was read, and patron != a->patron
now. Then patron must have been inserted between a and n.
3 - if swing good, link n.
4 -

Suppose n->gen == gen but n->p != a. Suppose p won.

If gen was the same but n->p was unlocked and other than a, then p won.
If gen was the same and n->p was locked and a->n != n, then p won.

If a still locked and p->patron is a, then p won if n->p == p.
If a still locked and p->patron isn't a, then p won.

If p->patron != a but a->p is n, then p won.

If a unlocked, then p failed.

How to detect if a fails, but then p succeeds after?
a will still be locked. a->n may have been changed, if n wrote a->n but then p
won before n could lock.

BTW - how does help_patron work in light of {a fail, p win} situation? Suppose
a fails b/c n is ded, then new gen of n becomes a->n again and p wins in
help_patron. So n never writes a->n again, but then n->p is a->patron by
accident at some point in the future and a's help_patron delinks n and n->p
because it thinks a->patron is still its patron.

a sets p->n := n. Then n dies, a fails to link n. Then new gen of n becomes
a->n again. Then p swings n->p := p. Now a is in help_patron.

Can you see a different <lingen, gen> combination than pat?

Suppose pat fails, unlocks, then drops ref. Can client assume pat succeeds?

8.19

Add:

/* If success, neither client nor p died. client hadn't incremented
    gen since it hadn't set nil.p when npx read, so must increment gen
    before it can die. p must do same to become nil.p after dying. So
    client must have still been ADDING, and we finished the job. */
cas64((pxchg){.p = client, .gen = px.gen + 1}, &l->nil.px, npx);

a marks. a2 finds it.
    a finishes. a2 only succeeds if p hasn't died and a hasn't finished.
    a2 finishes. 
    p finishes.

8.20

Omit ngen how? Suppose a writes p->n then n reinserts with new gen after a
reads ngen, then p succeeds. How can a detect it? pat->p != a and pat is same
gen as it was before you confirmed a->pat == pat,

When can you safely swing n, then? Do you need to read pat first? Suppose you
swung n, locked, failed, unlocked, then p won before n could write a->n. Then
you get pat+n again. Nobody writes to a->n or a->pat, but 

If p won, then it swung n or pat. If it swung pat then pat->p was
unlocked. Since pat was unlocked, pat hadn't committed to p yet or was
guaranteed to fail its swing, so there's no n but pat s.t. n->p == a

If p swung patron, then pat->p != a or pat is nonnode. But what if you read
pat->p == a but then it changes in the swing. wrote p->n = pat, then pat died,
you failed, got into help_patron to find pat alive again. P wins and swings
pat, but you swing n to yourself.

Mark pat->p to prevent p from winning then. p can't swing pat unless you
unlock it. Suppose you don't do this on the first go. Could someone be
swinging pat? 

Suppose you wrote p and won, then p read n, pat wrote p and won. 


 knew the gen of pat back when you were their
pat. But if you got between pat and p again, then pat's gen 

Could remove ngen, but then you have to ensure at every write that p hasn't
swung you - which is damn tricky. And you also have to check whether linref up
failure means someone else succeeded and you must restart or whether it means
p just finished your job for you. That means marking fields as dirty/clean to
ensure that they weren't written to while you did linref_up. Checking for
change isn't enough: imagine n := a->n failed linref_up b/c pat wrote n1, but
then n1 exits and n == a->n again. Writing and checking a not-dirty bit is
doable, but maybe costs too much to justify 4 bytes per anc and the (possible)
speed bonus of letting p "outlap" a. Seeing the same n := a->n with a
different gen should be pretty rare, I think.

Can use this dirty pointer technique to omit the failptr concept and do safe
unlocking (way simpler than full ngen removal). Just check whether a->n was
written to after the unlock. Or, better yet, do the next thing:

The point of excluding prevn from ref_down is that this guarantees that you
can linref_up until pat has a chance to update n. Otherwise, pat detects bad
n, linrefs down, then you fail linref up before pat has updated you. 

Nah, tons of cases. Like what if old n becomes p? Meh... Well, actually, you
just have two refs now. But nah.

Why is help_patron write to n safe again? You only write if it's the same gen
as it was when was set as nx.n, and also the same gen that pat recorded.

Why is the unlock safe? Suppose a->n == n. Then, when pat->ngen is read,
a->n == n 

The big win with using a failptr is that you're guaranteed to stay locked if p
wins. If p has to unlock like this, detecting p success is a different matter.

If r.gen is same and r.p is anything but a, p won.
If r.gen is diff, then n wrote some left node's n. Could be p swung n, then
linked with p->p. Wait. 

The problem with no failptr is that help_patron has to speculatively unlock
and then recheck that it has reason to unlock, whereas failptr unlock just
means checking the fail counter in place (your iff expression takes operands
stored in a single location) and involves no speculation. With non-failptr
unlock, and no extra rule, you can't be be sure that if p succeeds, then
p->locked and a->locked. Which is a really useful property. So going back to
failptr, though it won't work for multi-remove.

What if you store ngen in p? That gives you (simpler) failptr guarantees,
saves space, cuts down on reads, no?

And yes, an a->swung operation is neat too.

But how to check if pat is still your pat? Use gen? If gen is same as it was
before you checked pat == a->pat, then it's still your pat. But wait, you
should have a known ngen there - that's the point. If it's not known, don't
unlock. 

Having an a->swung gets rid of linref_up problems with ngenless version. If p
wins, then it keeps a linref on n until it writes a->p := SWUNG. So if linref
fails and p won, then a->p == SWUNG.

ngenless:

And if you do get ref but a->p != SWUNG? How do you know that pat/n haven't
been swung without a->p SWUNG being yet written, and then were both reused and
happened to be linked again? Just look at pat.p, no?

Buy what if n was the one you chose last (ie n->p was a). Then p won, so n->p
!=a, but p didn't write a->p := SWUNG. 

Again, goal is to help pat and write n->p if pat->p is a. If write fails, then
pat's write will fail, so notify pat and it'll get the message. 


8.23

Could go without failcount, but then need to mark a->n to detect overwrites in
help_patron. Otherwise, how do you know that you have the right ngen? Well,
you read npx beforehand anyway. 

Suppose you read npx and it matched ngen too. What could go wrong? IOTW, is
there any way you can succeed after pat fails? 

Suppose pat wrote n with older gen. Before you read npx, pat tried and failed
with this n. Then wrote new n and new ngen, and a read ngen, then a->n became
pat's new n again. pat->ngen happens to match new n's gen.

So recheck n. If you do, could pat be writing with an older gen? read ngen,
then pat wrote othern, failed, and wrote n again.

Checking for writes to n doesn't help if a fails but pat wins. a fails, n is
relinked to pat, then pat wins with new n but doesn't write to p.

Sum of ideas:
mark n to check for pat writes.
store ngen in pat->p.
store failcnt in pat->p.

8.26

So it seems like it should be possible to detect p swings with unsynched
version without too much trouble. But the problem is the unlocking
decision. You can't unlock and then retest because you may falsely unlock, p
swings the unlocked pat, but it was false and n swings n->n to point to a (it
loses the write from p). So it's a case where a fails but n succeeds. Is there
a reason that p can't swing pat, or a way to make that happen?

Instead, can get by with storing gen in a->p when locking and synchronize on
that. So if you've written p->n but haven't written a->p := ngen, then p
writes to a->p instead. That write is kind of likely to fail, sadly.

8.29

synced ngen has a problem with associating new ngen with old n. p succeeds
in such a case, but a doesn't. 

8.30

Back to ngenless. Do you have to worry about n shifting out under you?
Sure. Found n->p == a, set p->n = n, n disappeared and was then made a->n anew
with a new gen. But note that it can only shift if n->p == a and thus pat has
finished. Could just attempt a pat write - if it fails, detect the swungness
on the next help_patron loop, or if it succeeds, detect swungness... no, not
on p write (p->n may contain no indication that it swung). Need to check for
n->p == p and a->p == locked. But need to NOT think that pat needs to get
written. And remember, it may be that a->n->p != a without a->n having been
swung. (In contrast to a->pat, which you can find unlinked only if it was
swung or if it updated n).

Detecting swungness. Either p has died and set a->p = SWUNG, or n has died and
p hasn't and p->pat != a, or neither has died and n->p == p.

Who can swing? Just p from the last loop? You have to be pat for them to swing
your n. If someone other than the last p were

Marking n->p has the purpose of detecting whether pat's next write to any
node's p will fail. It will unmark each time it changes n and commits to a
write. If you mark it, then see a is still marked, then see p is still
marked, pat won't attempt any n writes till it relocks pat->p. Is it
guaranteed to fail the next n write?

Still need ngen read in pat if marking pat->p? 

9.2

Can you ever wind up with n swung, but falsely thinking that pat needs to be
unlocked? 

Say x == a->n and x->p == a, then after read and write of p->n = x, x dies, is
reinserted past x2, and x2 dies to set x as n and pat as x2, then p swings x.
